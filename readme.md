**TODOS before publish:**

    - make showtable page selectable, editable and removeable ()
    - let users create different projects -> able to create tickets for the specific project (therefore refactor the cli menu) ()

    - Publish

TODO:

- think of using sqllite to save data? ()

Feature Idea:

- Create Settings option (in main menu) so people can can customize the cli how they want
  - things to customize: colors, tags (like urgency, cost...)
