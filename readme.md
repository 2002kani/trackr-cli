**TODOS before npm publish:**

    - Make use of command execution ()
    - implement local JSON Storage ()
    - edit user friendly readme ()
    - make showtable page selectable, editable and removeable ()
    - let users create different projects -> able to create tickets for the specific project (therefore refactor the cli menu) ()

    - Publish

TODO today:

- if time, find a way to store data properly ()

Feature Idea:

- Create Settings option (in main menu) so people can can customize the cli how they want
  - things to customize: colors, tags (like urgency, cost...)
